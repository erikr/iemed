**Summary:**

IEMed enables medical students to explore the role of tech startups in healthcare.

New technologies such as cloud infrastructure, mobile phones, genomics, drug development, regenerative medicine, etc. are transforming healthcare. The practice of medicine will look very different in 20 years versus today. Recent emphasis on value-based care has created new market opportunities for startups, especially in areas related to care delivery and analytics.

Physicians can found, work at, or work with startups. However, these opportunities are difficult to pursue due to misaligned career incentives, regulatory complexity of healthcare, and few interactions with colleagues from engineering and business. We believe these challenges are surmountable, and envision a future where physicians engage in innovation and entrepreneurship to advance patient care.

IEMed is for 2nd year medical students, but professional and graduate students from any discipline are welcome to attend our sessions.

###Project

+ Students will form groups of 2-3 at the first session.
+ Each team will assess a startup using the [business model canvas](http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/canvas/bmc).
+ Each week, teams will focus on one part of the canvas, learn more about their chosen startup, and share their findings with the class.
+ MBA and JD students informally advise medical student teams.
+ At the end of the course, teams will summarize recommendations.

###Feedback from last year

Last year we administered a questionnaire before and after the course. Students rated agreement with several statements on a scale of 1-10; 5 was neutral, <5 indicated disagreement, and >5 indicated agreement.

Before: N = 9<br>
After: N = 7 *(everyone was studying for Step 1)*

<img src="/images/iemed2014_fig1.png" width="1500px" />

The overall rating of the elective was 8.6 ± 1.1 out of 10.

7 out of 7 students (100%) recommended the elective for next year's students.

We also asked students more detailed questions about their aspirations. Here are some notable responses:

> Why did you sign up for this elective? Discuss what you hope to learn.

+ "To gain some of the knowledge necessary to move medicine, and society, forward. We currently learn a lot of great ways to help people, but we also see the many problems and how better solutions are needed both systemically and for individual patients. Found my self craving a way to make a bigger impact, and there is a bigger reward in doing so."
+ "I have always been pretty business oriented. One of my possible goals is to actually run a hospital. I feel like this class will widen my horizons in topics other than medicine."
+ "I signed up because I want to be able to seize entrepreneurship opportunities in my career when they arise. I hope to learn mostly about start-up law and finance so that I understand the 'rules' around the game of starting a business venture in the world of medicine."

> Describe your ideal career in 2034.

+ "Not just practicing medicine alone for a living. I hope to be running a company that is developing and running clinical trials for new protocols, devices, and treatments to improve healthcare efficiency and outcomes. I am also interested in social policy.
May sound impossible, but I'd like to have a career with set hours and/or the ability to work from home."
+ "Hopefully, I will be a CEO (or some other administrative position) of a hospital system.
Primarily practicing surgeon but with a team of 2-3 people building/testing tools and running research protocols full time."
+ "Ideally I will be continuing a career in clinical medicine, but potentially serving as an advisor to VC firms interested in healthcare start-ups."

> Has your "ideal career in 2034" changed since you started the course? What is it now?

+ "Primarily a clinician, but heavily involved in improving tools, policies, and procedures for better health outcomes."
+ "I have realized I am a lot more interested in bigger scope issues."
+ "This elective has reinforced my career goals of becoming a physician-entrepreneur; or at least using my clinical knowledge/skills to pursue a broader role in healthcare / public health."
+ "I am on the fence when it comes to becoming a practicing clinician. I feel more likely to end up working at a start-up, a small company, or elsewhere in industry."
