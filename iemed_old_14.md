Welcome to "Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Medicine" (IEMed), an M2 elective course at Emory University School of Medicine. I ran this course with [Arun Mohan, MD, MBA](http://apollomd.com/emergency-department-management/emergency-medicine-management/leadership/arun-mohan-md/) in Fall 2014. We intend to offer IEMed again in Fall 2015.

###Course overview

Our goal is to expose medical students to topics and career opportunities in innovation and entrepreneurship.

Advances in technology - new vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutic devices - have revolutionized healthcare. New fields such as cloud and mobile computing are once more transforming how we help patients. Furthermore, national policy reform has shifted financial incentives and created new market opportunities for healthcare startups.

Physicians and medical students have many opportunities to become or work with technology innovators and/or entrepreneurs, but these opportunities are often non-obvious due to clinical workload, cultural differences between tech and academia, etc. Furthermore, healthcare startups deal with regulation, complex financial systems, and a high cost of entry.

Despite these challenges, we envision a future where physicians engage in technology innovation and entrepreneurship to advance patient care. This elective exposes medical students to this vision.

###Course outcomes

We administered a questionnaire before and after the elective. Students rated agreement with several statements on a scale of 1-10. 5 was neutral, below 5 indicated disagreement, and above 5 indicated agreement.

Before: N = 9<br>
After: N = 7 *(the M2s started studying for Step 1; two of them did not complete the survey)*

<img src="/images/iemed2014_fig1.png" width="1500px" />

The overall rating of the elective was 8.6 ± 1.1 out of 10.

7 out of 7 students (100%) recommended the elective for next year's students.

###Survey responses

Here are some notable responses from the students:

> Why did you sign up for this elective? Discuss what you hope to learn.

+ "To gain some of the knowledge necessary to move medicine, and society, forward. We currently learn a lot of great ways to help people, but we also see the many problems and how better solutions are needed both systemically and for individual patients. Found my self craving a way to make a bigger impact, and there is a bigger reward in doing so."
+ "I have always been pretty business oriented. One of my possible goals is to actually run a hospital. I feel like this class will widen my horizons in topics other than medicine."
+ "I signed up because I want to be able to seize entrepreneurship opportunities in my career when they arise. I hope to learn mostly about start-up law and finance so that I understand the 'rules' around the game of starting a business venture in the world of medicine."

> Describe your ideal career in 2034.

+ "Not just practicing medicine alone for a living. I hope to be running a company that is developing and running clinical trials for new protocols, devices, and treatments to improve healthcare efficiency and outcomes. I am also interested in social policy.
May sound impossible, but I'd like to have a career with set hours and/or the ability to work from home."
+ "Hopefully, I will be a CEO (or some other administrative position) of a hospital system.
Primarily practicing surgeon but with a team of 2-3 people building/testing tools and running research protocols full time."
+ "Ideally I will be continuing a career in clinical medicine, but potentially serving as an advisor to VC firms interested in healthcare start-ups."

> Has your "ideal career in 2034" changed since you started the course? What is it now?

+ "Primarily a clinician, but heavily involved in improving tools, policies, and procedures for better health outcomes."
+ "I have realized I am a lot more interested in bigger scope issues."
+ "This elective has reinforced my career goals of becoming a physician-entrepreneur; or at least using my clinical knowledge/skills to pursue a broader role in healthcare / public health."
+ "I am on the fence when it comes to becoming a practicing clinician. I feel more likely to end up working at a start-up, a small company, or elsewhere in industry."

> Suggest ONE topic we should have explored.

+ "Meeting a practicing clinical MD with a track record in medtech innovation."
+ "Most of my classmates face a gaping unknown regarding what's possible in the world of programming, device engineering, robotics, etc. They have articulated this deficit multiple times in our discussions. This lack of knowledge makes them less comfortable with tech/startup culture and leads them to gravitate more toward management/consulting/policy. While there's nothing wrong with the latter areas, I do not believe they are truly disinterested in tech innovation/startups!"
+ "The model of a way to actually found a start-up; how to get started, obtain funding, how to choose your team, etc. This would be most helpful with specifics, like how an actual local start-up was founded."

And one last thought that reflects my opinion on teaching:

+ "Another point about our schedule/curriculum -- this elective worked out because they were cognizant of our schedule and planned around our more stressful weeks (exams, OSCE evaluations, ramping up Step 1 review), and were very responsive to how we were feeling. This was a key part of the elective's success!"

Teachers must understand they exist to serve their constituency. Constructing a syllabus, scheduling sessions, and selecting technology for administering the course are decisions that should be made on the basis of maximizing learning, accessibility, and efficiency for the students.

We also emphasized that attendance was optional. If something is valuable, it need not be mandatory. Instructors should spend less time enforcing attendance and more time creating worthwhile learning opportunities. Everyone has other time demands - seminars, errands, emergencies. If you cannot make your course at least as important as other competing commitments, that is your fault, not the students'.

###Ideas for next year

+ Provide more training on customer discovery
+ Have students form groups of 3 for performing customer discovery
+ Session on design and psychology related to identifying unmet clinical needs
+ Fewer unstructured panels from startup founders
+ Integrate students from PhD, MBA, JD, MPH, RN and other allied health programs
+ 90-minute sessions focused on interactive Q&A and problem-solving with invited mentors (e.g. [flipped classroom model](http://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2012/10/03/using-the-flipped-classroom-model-to-re-imagine-medical-education/))
